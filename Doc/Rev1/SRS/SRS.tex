	This document describes the requirements for the game Wordle 2.0. The 
	template 
	for this Software Requirements Specification is a subset of the Volere 
	template[1].
	
	
	\section{Project Drivers}
	
	\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}
	The purpose of this project is to recreate the functionality of the web 
	game Wordle. Additionally, we aim to modernize the UI and add new features 
	such as a dark mode and more levels.
	\subsection{The Stakeholders}
	
	\subsubsection{The Client}
	The client is the professor for this course, Dr. Asghar Bokahri, and the 
	teaching assistants, Veerash Palanichamy, Oluwaseun Owojaiye, and Abdul Rab 
	Mohammed. The clients will provide us with deadlines on deliverables, and 
	will 
	have the final decision on the project's acceptance and adherence to the 
	SRS. 
	
	\subsubsection{The Customers}
	In this case, the customers are all people who will play the Wordle 2.0 
	game. 
	This game targets people of a demographics and will have minimal hardware 
	requirements to decrease the barriers to access.
	
	\subsubsection{Other Stakeholders}
	The developers of this project are also stakeholders. Without them, there 
	would 
	be no Wordle 2.0. The skills of individual team members, both technical and 
	soft skills, will be put to use to complete this project. They 
	will be 
	responsible for the implementation, documentation, and testing of the 
	product. 
	Additionally, the original developers and contributors to the Wordle Clone 
	repository will be stakeholders in this project as they are constantly 
	updating the respository and wish to improve the game.
	
	\subsection{Mandated Constraints}
	\subsubsection{Solution Constraints}
	\noindent \textbf{Description:} Wordle must be able to run on any modern 
	browser or laptop.\\
	\textbf{Rationale:} The potential users of Wordle will need to have the 
	listed browsers. \\
	\textbf{Fit Criterion:} Wordle will run on any latest version of node.

	\subsubsection{Schedule Constraints}
	\noindent \textbf{Description:} The Project must follow the project 
	schedule shown in the Development Plan\\
	\textbf{Rationale:} The Project needs to follow a predefined plan 
	to ensure the completion of the milestones by their respective due dates. \\
	\textbf{Fit Criterion:} The Project will be completed with all milestones 
	submitted on time.

	\subsection{Relevant Facts and Assumptions}
	
	Facts:\\ The original repository is still being updated constantly. 
	However, 
	we
	are implementing and improving the version of the repository we found at the
	start of the term. This is to avoid having the original repository grow too
	large for the scope of our project. \\ Originally the repository did not 
	have
	a dark theme, various word length game modes, or hard mode where all guesses
	must contain correct letters from previous guesses. \\ Assumptions: \\ 
	Users will use a system with a web
	browser and have internet access. \\ Users will know how to operate a
	computer or phone.\\ Users have a moderate proficiency in English, at least 
	a
	middle school level.
	
	\section{Functional Requirements}
	
	\subsection{The Scope of the Work and the Product}
	
	\subsubsection{The Context of the Work}
	Wordle 2.0 is a standalone application that doesn't interact with other 
	folders or systems. It is meant to be played by one person at a time.

	\end{enumerate}

		be 
		displayed by the system encouraging users to take regular breaks.}
	\end{enumerate}
	\section{Project Issues}
	
	\subsection{Open Issues} We have not decided on a testing framework as no
	Javascript framework is considered the best solution according to the
	programming community. Currently leaning towards using JEST or Cypress, but
	still exploring the limitations of each. \\
	We are also not proficient with TypeScript, thus it is uncertain how 
	difficult it will be to modularize the source code as it is written in 
	TypeScript. 
	
	\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
	Wordle is the original version of this game. However, its source code is 
	not 
	published. There are few public solutions specific to the creation of 
	Wordle 
	2.0; any code adapted for the project will come from Not Wordle.
	\subsubsection{Ready-Made Products}
	Wordle Clones exist in the market. One such example is the source 
	repository.
	\subsubsection{Reusable Components}
	The source repository has resusable components that can be replicated on a 
	need-to-need basis.
	\subsubsection{Products That Can Be Copied}
	The source repository has an MIT licence and thus redistribution or 
	replication 
	of the product is allowed.
	
	\subsection{New Problems}
	
	\subsection{Tasks} Tasks are assigned and specified using a \href
	{https://gitlab.cas.mcmaster.ca/zacharin/wordle_clone_3xa3_l01_group8/-/blob/main/ProjectSchedule/3xa3_group8.gan}{\color{blue}Gantt
		Chart}. The chart is maintained and updated through the lifetime of the
	product’s development. 
	
	\subsection{Migration to the New Product}
	N/A. This product will remain independent of the source code.
	\subsection{Risks}
	There is little to no risk associated with this project. 
	The 
	program is designed to run within a web browser which has very little 
	interaction with other processes running within the user's system. Any 
	risks stemming from the program itself may occur in the form of crashes and 
	ppoor performance. Test driven development will be done to minimize these 
	risks.
	\subsection{Costs}
	
	The development of the project will have no cost. Under the MIT licence, the
	source project is allowed to be modified and distributed freely. 
	The
	applications used for development are also free. An estimated time cost for
	development is 6 hours a week for all developers. 
	
	\subsection{User Documentation and Training}
	\subsubsection{User Documentation Requirements}
	Instructions will be included as an option in the game's main menu.
	The game's directory will contain a README file providing installation 
	instructions.
	
	\subsubsection{Training Requirements}
	No specific training is necessary to play Wordle 2.0. Controls should be 
	intuitive.
	
	\subsection{Waiting Room}
	Should there be additional time, the following low priority features will 
	be 
	considered and implemented:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Different world lengths. The user would be able to change the 
		gameplay mode to include words that are not 5 letters in length
		\item Allow for multiplayer functionality.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\subsection{Ideas for Solutions}
	N/A.
